02:26.180 --> 02:27.060
Mr. Deen.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.310
Good morning, Jen.

02:28.440 --> 02:29.440
Hey, how’s that little sister?

02:29.650 --> 02:30.440
Great, two weeks old now.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.110
Oh my gosh.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.360
I was wondering, could you help
me out with my college essays?

02:34.980 --> 02:36.190
I’d be happy to.

02:36.650 --> 02:38.200
Where are you,
where are you applying?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.410
UPEN, Pensylvania...

02:41.070 --> 02:42.950
Hey, jerk off.
Leave her alone, alright?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.160
-Relax, waste away.
-Nathan--

02:44.290 --> 02:46.120
Okay, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.250
Shit, man, get off me.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.340
What are you doing?

02:57.170 --> 02:58.720
What, I can’t
defend my girlfriend?

02:58.840 --> 03:00.220
We were just talking.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.260
-Oh yeah?...about what?
-Yeah.

03:02.600 --> 03:03.810
I don’t know.

03:04.470 --> 03:07.980
-Life, school,... the play.
-What else?

03:09.350 --> 03:10.900
Don’t be weird.

03:14.230 --> 03:16.650
Mr. Deen. Hi.

03:17.030 --> 03:17.860
Hi, Tina.

03:17.990 --> 03:21.610
Yo, Nate, Nate,
we’re on for tonight, dude.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.700
Come on.

03:53.980 --> 03:55.860
Dude, hurry!

03:56.570 --> 03:57.230
Keys!?

03:57.360 --> 03:58.740
Yeah, I got’em, get in.

04:14.540 --> 04:16.290
What’s that?
200, 300?

04:16.420 --> 04:18.090
At least!
VCR’s are hot.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.130
Yeah!

04:19.550 --> 04:22.300
Yo, guess what? Party time.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.650
♪ We are the sons of no one, ♪

04:35.810 --> 04:37.940
♪ bastards of young. ♪

04:38.980 --> 04:41.940
♪ We are the sons of no one, ♪

04:42.070 --> 04:44.070
♪ bastards of young. ♪

04:56.170 --> 04:59.340
-Nate...
-Nathan...

04:59.710 --> 05:02.010
-Yo Nate.
-Nathan, Nathan...

05:03.170 --> 05:06.140
Nathan,
Nathan, where’s Nathan?

05:07.100 --> 05:08.470
Nathan!

05:09.560 --> 05:11.520
I think he’s--

05:11.640 --> 05:12.390
here.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.360
Yo, come on.

05:24.070 --> 05:25.610
Where’d you
stay last night?

05:25.990 --> 05:27.370
My uncle’s.

05:27.620 --> 05:28.450
Crashing there for now.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.740
But it’s so far away.

05:29.990 --> 05:30.870
Nah!

05:31.120 --> 05:32.370
Got my wheels.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.500
When am I gonna get
to meet them?

05:35.540 --> 05:37.170
Are they coming
to the track meet?

05:39.170 --> 05:40.130
Get a room, you two.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.140
Hi.

05:50.850 --> 05:51.720
Good luck.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.060
-Sir.
-Okay, go get them.

05:59.020 --> 06:00.690
You know you got this, right?

06:00.820 --> 06:01.940
Good luck.

06:09.870 --> 06:10.870
On your mark.

06:11.490 --> 06:12.410
Get set.

06:53.030 --> 06:54.200
Nate!

06:55.830 --> 06:56.790
That was nice running, man.

06:57.080 --> 06:57.830
Thanks, man.

06:58.210 --> 06:59.210
Hey, did you sell
any of that stuff yet?

06:59.540 --> 07:01.960
Uh no, but Noah said we
can get like 400 for the lot.

07:02.080 --> 07:02.790
Ok cool.

07:03.170 --> 07:04.550
Hey, do you want
to do something tonight?

07:04.670 --> 07:05.460
I can come to your place.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.300
Shit, man, I can’t.

07:06.420 --> 07:07.590
My stepmom’s making me do this

07:07.720 --> 07:09.300
like boring
family dinner, you know?

07:09.630 --> 07:10.970
Yeah, I know I should do
a family dinner too.

07:11.090 --> 07:11.930
Do that test paper.

07:12.350 --> 07:13.140
Ah!

07:13.930 --> 07:14.970
Test paper!

07:15.310 --> 07:16.770
You’re gonna be a
college boy now, Nate?

07:17.180 --> 07:18.180
All right, later.

09:39.030 --> 09:40.910
I look at you,
I see a doctor.

09:41.580 --> 09:43.410
But I never acted before,
Mr. Deen.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.580
And that’s why this is
the perfect role to start with.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.830
Couldn’t I at least be like

09:48.960 --> 09:51.170
a--is there a
football player part?

09:51.500 --> 09:52.630
There are no football players

09:52.760 --> 09:54.380
in Flowers
for Algernon, Barnaby.

09:54.510 --> 09:56.970
But there are doctors.

09:58.590 --> 09:59.970
And I know you can do it.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.210
Morning, Nate.

10:32.340 --> 10:33.300
How are you today?

10:33.460 --> 10:35.380
Morning, Mr. Deen.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.650
You’ll need this.

10:55.530 --> 10:59.410
And on behalf of the
Spartan Social Committee,

11:00.030 --> 11:02.450
you’ve been nominated the
winner of this

11:02.580 --> 11:04.620
delicious candy bar.

11:07.290 --> 11:08.500
That’s it.

11:09.170 --> 11:10.000
Of course.

11:10.960 --> 11:11.880
Go ahead.

11:14.710 --> 11:15.760
Enjoy.

11:17.670 --> 11:20.430
Morning, Noah. Hand those
out for me, will you?

11:20.840 --> 11:21.590
Morning, Carl.

11:21.840 --> 11:22.680
Morning, Mr Deen.

11:23.100 --> 11:23.800
Morning, Jen.

11:26.060 --> 11:26.850
How’s it going Mr. Deen

11:26.970 --> 11:27.640
Morning, Johnny.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.520
Tina.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.310
Morning, Mr. Deen.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.310
Morning.

11:52.290 --> 11:53.880
Oh, not those, Mr. Deen.

11:54.040 --> 11:54.840
Hey, Linda.

11:55.710 --> 11:56.550
Any news?

11:57.170 --> 11:58.260
I’ve been accepted.

11:59.550 --> 12:00.760
I start next semester.

12:01.090 --> 12:02.550
See, I told you.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.010
Thanks. Oh, hey.

12:04.550 --> 12:07.350
I kept these
especially for you.

12:07.680 --> 12:08.390
Fresh?

12:08.640 --> 12:09.310
Freshest.

12:13.810 --> 12:15.230
And what are
you doing with those?

12:16.570 --> 12:17.780
Hi, Deb.

12:18.070 --> 12:20.110
You are a very bad boy, Stan.

12:29.330 --> 12:30.790
How’d it go in tennis?

12:30.910 --> 12:32.830
We lost. Straight sets.

12:33.500 --> 12:34.540
Really? Doubles?

12:34.670 --> 12:36.000
Of course.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.880
Roger was taking lessons, but
he’s got tennis elbow again.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.260
When are you going to join?
We need more players.

12:42.380 --> 12:44.180
Oh, next semester, for sure.

12:44.300 --> 12:46.550
You said that all last season.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.350
Hey, where’s that racket
I bought you?

12:51.270 --> 12:52.180
Stan?

12:52.890 --> 12:53.600
Are you okay?

12:54.270 --> 12:55.230
Really?

12:55.770 --> 12:56.860
You know how it is, Deb.

12:56.980 --> 12:59.020
You leave the house
at 6:30 in the morning.

12:59.150 --> 13:00.900
You don’t get home
until 10:30 at night.

13:03.110 --> 13:04.030
Where is that racket?

13:04.280 --> 13:05.280
I bet it’s down this hallway.

13:05.530 --> 13:07.070
In the basement.
I think it’s in the basement.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.660
It’s not there.
It’s in the base--

13:21.460 --> 13:23.470
You gotta be kidding me.

13:29.600 --> 13:30.560
Seriously?

13:31.390 --> 13:32.560
I’m sorry.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.850
Stan, I promised
you’d drop this off months ago.

13:38.150 --> 13:39.610
This isn’t good for you.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.650
It’s been a while now.

13:44.070 --> 13:45.150
I know. You’re right.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.490
This too shall pass.

14:04.340 --> 14:06.260
The Telecomic Woman
Maker Tuesday posted its

14:06.380 --> 14:08.930
first quarterly
operating loss in 16 years.

14:09.260 --> 14:11.260
Company CEO
Christopher Galvin says

14:11.390 --> 14:13.600
that the earliest signs
of a turnaround

14:13.770 --> 14:15.640
will come with a
gradual increase in sales

14:15.770 --> 14:18.350
and profitability in
the second half of the year.

14:18.480 --> 14:19.270
It’s official.

14:19.940 --> 14:22.860
Liberty Media and ATandamp;T
will split this summer. Thank--

15:19.870 --> 15:20.960
It’s cute, right?

15:21.080 --> 15:21.790
Yeah.

15:21.960 --> 15:22.710
Little mittens.

15:22.840 --> 15:23.710
Mm-hmm.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.050
What’s yours?

15:26.460 --> 15:27.210
I don’t know.

15:27.800 --> 15:28.630
It’s cool though, right?

15:30.130 --> 15:30.840
Hey!

15:30.970 --> 15:31.970
Is Nathan Williams present?

15:32.340 --> 15:33.640
Yes, he’s right here.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.260
Nathan Williams,
you’re under arrest.

15:35.470 --> 15:36.270
Turn around.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.520
Hands behind your back.

15:37.980 --> 15:38.980
You have the
right to remain silent.

15:39.310 --> 15:40.480
Anything you say,
can, and will be

15:40.600 --> 15:42.020
used against you
in a court of law.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.400
You were right to an attorney--

15:43.520 --> 15:44.270
What is happening?

15:44.400 --> 15:45.440
I’m not a bad guy.

15:45.570 --> 15:46.440
I know.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.940
-...rights that I’ve read you.
-Yes.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.530
In hearing these rights,
Do you wish to talk to --

15:49.650 --> 15:51.110
Where are you taking him?

15:52.990 --> 15:53.870
It’s okay.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.220
Turn to your right.

16:22.440 --> 16:23.440
Strip.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.530
All the way.

16:39.080 --> 16:40.500
You’re in trouble,
Nathan.

16:41.660 --> 16:43.120
Who was with you?

16:44.960 --> 16:45.960
No one.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.670
You did this alone?

16:50.670 --> 16:51.920
A witness said
they saw someone,

16:52.050 --> 16:52.840
maybe two other peo--.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.050
I was on my own.

16:58.890 --> 17:00.060
You get to make
one phone call.

17:00.430 --> 17:01.180
Let’s go.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.480
I don--I don’t have
anyone to call.

17:07.690 --> 17:09.270
Oh, sorry.
Morning, Barnaby.

17:09.650 --> 17:12.030
Nadine, Paul, Chris, Madison.

17:13.030 --> 17:13.860
Morning.

17:14.570 --> 17:15.780
I know, John,
but what did he do?

17:15.950 --> 17:17.490
Hey, does
anyone know if Nathan--

17:19.200 --> 17:20.160
It was burglary.

17:20.490 --> 17:21.410
Someone’s home?

17:21.660 --> 17:23.660
It was West Barnes’
appliance store in New Holland.

17:24.670 --> 17:26.710
Did they have to arrest him
in front of the whole school?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.250
Couldn’t you have
called him into your office?

17:29.380 --> 17:30.250
It sends a message.

17:30.420 --> 17:32.340
The whole school
got that message, John.

17:32.670 --> 17:34.130
Well, how
else do you expect to

17:34.260 --> 17:35.630
get through
to a kid like that?

17:35.930 --> 17:36.890
A kid like what?

17:37.260 --> 17:39.640
What kind of kid do
you think he is, Miriam?

17:40.180 --> 17:42.390
He’s disrespectful and lazy.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.810
His grades certainly
aren’t up to par.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.020
And he’s the only
kid at Garden Spot like that?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.980
He’s a heck of an
athlete, right, Coach?

17:48.860 --> 17:49.940
Well, um...

17:50.610 --> 17:51.530
What are we doing here?

17:51.650 --> 17:52.860
Aren’t we supposed to inspire

17:52.990 --> 17:54.820
these kids to
become something great?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.320
good morning--
-you know?

17:56.450 --> 17:58.490
all rise for
the Pledge of Allegiance

17:58.620 --> 18:00.280
I pledge allegiance,
to the flag

18:00.410 --> 18:02.240
of the United States of America

18:02.410 --> 18:04.500
John, do you know if Nathan’s
posted bail or not?

18:05.580 --> 18:06.250
I don’t know.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.790
I’m trying to get in
touch with the foster parents.

18:09.290 --> 18:11.300
: with liberty
and justice for all.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.020
Good morning, ma’am.

19:11.440 --> 19:16.070
I’m here to
see Nathan Williams.

19:16.440 --> 19:17.490
Are you family?

19:18.610 --> 19:20.240
No. No, I’m his teacher.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.490
Can’t let you back
unless you’re family.

19:23.240 --> 19:24.370
Well, at Garden Spot,
we like to think

19:24.490 --> 19:25.990
of all of our
students as family.

19:26.580 --> 19:29.290
Well, we don’t.
You have to be family.

19:30.580 --> 19:32.750
It’s really important, please.

19:36.760 --> 19:38.670
I’d like to see
the warden, please.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.550
The warden’s busy.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.180
You just tell him,
Stan Deen’s here.

19:43.470 --> 19:45.470
I’ll... I’ll wait.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.740
Mr. Deen.

20:04.780 --> 20:06.080
Tom Friedman?

20:06.450 --> 20:08.950
Oh, my gosh,
I can’t believe it.

20:09.080 --> 20:10.580
What’s it been, 20 years?

20:10.830 --> 20:12.000
Yeah, at least.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.000
Well, what are you doing?

20:13.130 --> 20:14.330
Are you at the
Garden Spot still?

20:14.460 --> 20:15.960
Yeah, yep, I’m still there.

20:17.000 --> 20:17.920
I’m still there.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.590
I’m not leaving till
they name something after me.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.260
So, what are you
doing in here today?

20:47.910 --> 20:49.160
You gonna yell at me, Mr. Deen?

20:49.540 --> 20:50.910
No, of course not.

20:52.620 --> 20:54.790
You don’t belong here, Nate.
We’re gonna get you out.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.670
All right?

20:57.630 --> 20:59.300
Do you have
any family I can call?

21:02.590 --> 21:03.380
No one?

21:04.340 --> 21:05.140
No.

21:07.300 --> 21:07.970
Who were you living with

21:08.100 --> 21:09.770
before you went
into foster care?

21:10.890 --> 21:12.390
-My nanny and grandpa.
-Okay.

21:12.640 --> 21:15.150
That-- it’s been a
very long time, Mr. Deen.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.860
I don’t think they’d want
to help, if they’re still alive.

21:18.730 --> 21:21.400
Well, we’re gonna
give it a try. All right?

21:25.610 --> 21:27.660
Nate, I need a name.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.290
Cole.

21:31.410 --> 21:32.830
C-O-L-E?

21:33.160 --> 21:35.920
Yeah, they’re up
in Lebanon. They were.

21:36.040 --> 21:37.210
All right.

21:38.210 --> 21:40.050
We’ll find a
way to get you out.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.920
Sorry for wasting
your time, Mr. Deen.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.840
It’s some guy from the high
school

25:51.960 --> 25:53.050
he called and let us know.

25:56.130 --> 25:57.180
Hold on Bonnie--

25:57.300 --> 25:58.300
Good morning ma’am.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.930
I’m Stan Deen,
Nathan’s teacher.

26:00.430 --> 26:02.060
Is he here?

26:04.270 --> 26:05.640
Nathan’s teacher.--

26:06.520 --> 26:07.940
I don’t know.

26:09.150 --> 26:10.570
Hey, what are you doing here?

26:10.980 --> 26:12.610
Hey Nate, hi.

26:13.780 --> 26:16.780
Gee, I hoped I’d see you
back in class by now.

26:16.910 --> 26:19.280
He’s got a job.
He don’t need no school.

26:19.570 --> 26:21.080
Dropping out of school, huh?

26:21.410 --> 26:24.410
Uh oh. I’ll be out of
a job if that gets around.

26:27.870 --> 26:31.040
Nate, you
gotta get back in school.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.590
What’s gonna happen
when you go on trial?

26:33.920 --> 26:34.800
Whaddya mean?

26:35.090 --> 26:36.300
When he goes to
court, he has to show

26:36.420 --> 26:38.090
the judge he’s not
that person anymore.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.640
And the best way to do that

26:40.760 --> 26:43.470
is to go back to
school and graduate.

26:43.850 --> 26:45.310
New Holland’s too far.

26:45.430 --> 26:47.230
His car’s impounded
till the trial.

26:47.350 --> 26:49.600
What she means is,
they put up my bail.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.270
I gotta work
for them to pay it back.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.530
Bonnie, I’ll call you back.

26:55.690 --> 26:58.860
We can’t put up bail
every time he gets in trouble.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.530
Well, plenty of
kids get a part-time job.

27:02.530 --> 27:07.540
Nate, where was the foster home
you were staying at before?

27:09.670 --> 27:10.330
Nathan?

27:13.130 --> 27:16.800
I wasn’t in a foster home.
I was living in my car.

27:17.550 --> 27:18.430
Your car?

27:19.180 --> 27:20.840
What do you mean your car?

27:21.140 --> 27:24.310
You lived in your car? Where?

27:24.890 --> 27:26.350
I don’t know. Quiet places.

27:27.100 --> 27:28.350
Fields, mostly.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.400
How’d you eat?

27:30.600 --> 27:32.520
I didn’t. Not really.

27:32.650 --> 27:33.860
That Hershey bar
you gave me was the

27:33.980 --> 27:35.780
only meal I had
in like three days.

27:35.900 --> 27:36.780
Oh my gosh.

27:37.240 --> 27:38.650
Why do you think
I was on the track team?

27:39.950 --> 27:41.910
So I could shower, Mr. Deen.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.370
Nate, we have got
to get you back in school.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.460
Why? Show’em I’m a con?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.670
What are you doin’ in here?

27:51.290 --> 27:52.630
Oh, Gosh.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.800
This is Nathan’s teacher.

27:57.170 --> 27:59.340
He wants to get
Nathan back in school.

27:59.670 --> 28:02.050
Yeah, that’s right.

28:04.680 --> 28:05.760
Who is this?

28:06.600 --> 28:09.230
Nathan’s mother. Gloria.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.690
She’s beautiful.

28:11.850 --> 28:13.350
She died when I was six.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.480
Terrible accident. Car accident.

28:17.190 --> 28:18.530
Died instant like.

28:18.650 --> 28:19.820
Nanny...

28:20.150 --> 28:21.320
Don’t start that again.

28:21.820 --> 28:25.200
You can’t keep making
up stories about what happened.

28:25.950 --> 28:28.700
Right when he was little,
he made up stories.

28:29.450 --> 28:30.620
Upsetting people.

28:31.790 --> 28:33.580
After she died, we couldn’t...

28:35.710 --> 28:38.960
a little child
needs a lot of keepin’.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.590
We thought the orphanage
would give him a good home.

28:41.930 --> 28:43.010
My Lord.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.850
I’m sorry, but
what about the father?

28:46.140 --> 28:47.930
We don’t speak
about that piece of trash.

28:48.470 --> 28:50.140
As I tell Nathaniel,

28:50.270 --> 28:53.350
he better forget that man
ever drew a living breath.

28:54.230 --> 28:55.730
Otherwise,
people will think

28:55.900 --> 28:58.150
the apple don’t
fall far from the tree.

28:58.860 --> 29:00.900
She shouldn’t have took
up with him in the first place.

29:01.610 --> 29:03.070
She brought it on herself.

29:04.700 --> 29:06.030
C’mon, Nathaniel.

29:10.580 --> 29:12.040
Nate. Nate.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.210
Here’s my number.

29:14.330 --> 29:16.960
If you change your mind,
I promise you...

29:19.340 --> 29:20.670
We’ll figure this out.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.170
Thanks.

29:38.570 --> 29:39.400
I know.

29:39.770 --> 29:42.070
It’s just a little upsetting
when the first person

29:42.190 --> 29:44.280
isn’t somebody
faceless in the newspaper.

29:45.070 --> 29:46.200
But someone you know...

29:47.450 --> 29:48.700
someone you care about.

29:49.870 --> 29:52.120
If Charlie is chosen
and we succeed,

29:52.330 --> 29:54.370
he will have more
than a new life.

29:54.580 --> 29:55.750
He will have a life.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.420
And if we fail,

29:57.540 --> 30:00.340
he will have made a greater
contribution to mankind

30:00.460 --> 30:03.050
than most normal people
could ever hope to do.

30:03.550 --> 30:05.380
You think he has
a future as an actor.

30:05.590 --> 30:08.180
I don’t think Barnaby
has any future as an actor.

30:08.300 --> 30:09.050
I mean...

30:10.810 --> 30:11.510
But...

30:13.680 --> 30:15.480
I can see him
disappearing into his shell,

30:15.690 --> 30:17.190
you know, this
thing with his knee, and...

30:18.480 --> 30:19.690
There’s a terrific kid there.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.280
And if I can help...

30:24.490 --> 30:26.360
even at Flowers
for Algernon’s expense...

30:27.950 --> 30:30.990
then... I mean, what the heck?

30:33.330 --> 30:35.710
No one walks out
of a Stan Deen production.

30:36.370 --> 30:37.170
Except me.

30:48.840 --> 30:51.850
Hey, hi, Mr. Deen.
It’s Nate. Nate Williams.

30:52.850 --> 30:53.560
Uh...

30:54.470 --> 30:56.100
I’ve been thinking about
what you said.

30:57.520 --> 30:58.940
I’d like to come back to school.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.550
Before we do this,
I need something from you.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.770
I need to know you trust me.

31:36.140 --> 31:37.100
I trust you.

31:38.600 --> 31:39.480
Let’s tell
each other something

31:39.600 --> 31:41.480
about ourselves
neither of us knows.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.650
Okay? I’ll go first.

31:44.900 --> 31:45.610
Uh...

31:48.990 --> 31:50.360
I wanted to be a movie star.

31:51.530 --> 31:52.280
What?

31:52.490 --> 31:55.870
Yep. I was gonna
be the next James Deen.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.830
I already had the last name.

32:03.460 --> 32:04.790
You don’t know
who that is, do you?

32:04.920 --> 32:05.800
mm-mmm

32:06.710 --> 32:10.010
I quit my teaching job
and I moved out to California.

32:10.680 --> 32:11.800
Why’d you come back?

32:12.930 --> 32:14.220
Didn’t work out.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.970
Okay, your turn.

32:20.180 --> 32:21.730
I don’t like reading out loud.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.980
I already know that.
I also know you’re good at it.

32:25.110 --> 32:26.610
Okay, what’s something
no one knows?

32:28.690 --> 32:29.900
I like photography.

32:32.570 --> 32:34.160
-Let’s go with that.
-Yeah, can we go now?

32:38.370 --> 32:40.500
Does Mrs. Baker
know you like photography?

32:42.370 --> 32:43.710
Okay, got it. Not cool.

33:19.580 --> 33:20.580
Wow.

33:21.160 --> 33:22.460
Pretty great, huh?

33:22.870 --> 33:24.420
It’s a mid-century ranch.

33:24.670 --> 33:25.960
No. No.

33:27.670 --> 33:29.090
It’s more of a dump
than my car, Mr. Deen.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.380
Okay. You’re
sleeping on the couch.

33:34.510 --> 33:36.220
You can just push that stuff--

33:39.010 --> 33:40.720
The couch is
quite comfortable.

33:41.470 --> 33:43.310
but I’ll make some
house calls tomorrow

33:43.430 --> 33:45.940
and see if I can
find something better for you,

33:46.100 --> 33:47.060
your highness.

33:48.020 --> 33:49.070
Is this your mom?

33:49.270 --> 33:51.690
Huh? Yeah, my dad took that.

33:51.900 --> 33:53.440
He was a photographer, too.

33:53.780 --> 33:54.650
Professional.

33:55.280 --> 33:56.280
Where is your mom?

33:57.450 --> 33:58.740
She, uh...

33:59.530 --> 34:00.950
She passed.

34:02.450 --> 34:04.500
Last... last January.

34:05.080 --> 34:05.830
Sorry

34:05.960 --> 34:07.830
It’s all right. It’s all right.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.210
You know,
she had a big stroke,

34:10.340 --> 34:12.210
I guess,
about eight years ago, and...

34:14.340 --> 34:15.340
I looked after her.

34:16.930 --> 34:17.840
Can I use your bathroom?

34:18.010 --> 34:21.350
Yeah, yeah. Sure, of course.
It’s just through there.

34:45.290 --> 34:50.040
♪ It’s time to
start a show tonight ♪

34:50.170 --> 34:51.500
Hey! There you are.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.340
I was gonna
send out a search party.

34:54.050 --> 34:56.090
We are having pasta for dinner.

34:56.380 --> 34:58.010
Now, the secret to good pasta.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.300
I don’t like pasta.

35:00.340 --> 35:01.640
That’s because you
haven’t had mine.

35:02.510 --> 35:04.270
Now, the way
they do it in Italia

35:04.470 --> 35:08.190
is you add the
spaghetti to the sauce,

35:08.310 --> 35:09.810
and not the
sauce to the spaghetti.

35:09.940 --> 35:11.520
Mama mia no signori, ah.

35:11.690 --> 35:12.440
You know how to cook?

35:12.650 --> 35:13.320
Yeah.

35:13.440 --> 35:17.400
My mom was not a fan of
Chinese takeout or pizza, so...

35:19.570 --> 35:20.780
Is this your dad?

35:21.990 --> 35:22.830
Yeah.

35:24.160 --> 35:25.750
He used to make
me carry all his gear.

35:26.160 --> 35:27.120
I hated it.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.290
He thought it was hysterical.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.080
That was in
the Blue Mountains.

35:32.210 --> 35:33.130
He was a photographer.

35:33.250 --> 35:35.050
Yeah. He was
the main photographer

35:35.170 --> 35:36.800
for the
Hamilton Watch Company.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.050
What about your dad?

35:38.590 --> 35:40.180
Yeah, which one?
I had a lot of ’em.

35:40.510 --> 35:42.140
Right. No, I meant your real--

35:42.260 --> 35:43.050
What’s this?

35:43.300 --> 35:45.010
That was a play I was in.

35:45.260 --> 35:47.980
My mom kept all that stuff
I sent home from Hollywood.

35:48.310 --> 35:50.020
What kind of
work did your dad do?

35:50.190 --> 35:51.310
Were you in any movies?

35:51.560 --> 35:53.270
I was in one.

35:53.650 --> 35:56.360
The sum total of my role
was getting punched in the face.

35:57.570 --> 35:58.900
I’d like to see that.

36:00.450 --> 36:03.870
Ecco! Time to put
the spaghetti in the sauce.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.060
Morning.

36:28.810 --> 36:29.930
-Morning, Jen.
-Morning.

36:30.060 --> 36:32.350
Travis. Travis.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.190
Thank you.

36:38.190 --> 36:39.320
Morning, Renee.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.660
We are here to sign this
young man back into school.

36:46.700 --> 36:51.830
So, you have a
convicted felon living with you.

36:52.420 --> 36:54.580
Until I can find him
somewhere more permanent.

36:55.210 --> 36:58.090
And actually, Miriam,
he’s out on bail.

36:58.380 --> 37:01.220
Oh, sorry.
Soon-to-be-convicted.

37:02.680 --> 37:03.590
Is there a problem?

37:03.760 --> 37:05.050
Yes, there is, Stan.

37:05.430 --> 37:06.970
You have brought him back here.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.310
What exactly do you
know about this kid?

37:10.060 --> 37:11.560
I know he likes photography.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.020
Had you spotted that, Miriam?

37:14.190 --> 37:15.100
No, bet you hadn’t.

37:15.230 --> 37:18.610
You should be very careful
taking in a kid like that.

37:18.940 --> 37:22.530
If things start going missing,
don’t complain or come to us.

37:22.740 --> 37:26.700
Guys, I know exactly
why he was arrested, all right?

37:27.450 --> 37:31.500
I also know that he was living
out of his car for two years.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.500
Going hungry, only running track
so he could get a shower.

37:34.620 --> 37:37.080
Well, let the system
take care of him, Stan.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.550
You know, I didn’t understand
how no one saw this happening.

37:47.510 --> 37:51.560
But, you’ve all
just made that real clear.

37:51.970 --> 37:54.100
So, thank you.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.150
Today’s quote
is from Jonathan Swift...

37:58.270 --> 37:58.940
Hey...

37:59.070 --> 37:59.900
Yo, you’re back.

38:00.020 --> 38:01.230
Yeah, with a record.

38:02.150 --> 38:03.110
I owe you buddy.

38:03.320 --> 38:04.780
Yeah, I can’t hang out
with you, dude.

38:05.110 --> 38:06.490
I gotta stay
clean till the hearing.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.370
Yeah, here when you need me.

38:10.160 --> 38:11.160
Hey, hey, wait.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.620
Wait.

38:14.410 --> 38:15.920
I missed you so freaking much.

38:18.210 --> 38:19.210
I thought they kicked you out.

38:21.670 --> 38:22.760
Yeah, I’m turning around.

38:23.590 --> 38:25.010
Why did you lie to me?

38:26.300 --> 38:28.550
You were sleeping in
your car this whole time.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.140
So what? It’s pretty
freaking sweet, right?

38:31.640 --> 38:32.810
I can’t date you anymore.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.480
What? Hey...

38:36.940 --> 38:39.020
My dad said I can’t
see you anymore.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.230
What do you want?

38:43.570 --> 38:44.320
Huh?

38:47.910 --> 38:49.820
No, I can’t. I can’t.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.410
My dad can be real mean.

38:53.120 --> 38:54.370
He gave me no choice.

38:55.330 --> 38:56.000
Come on.

38:56.120 --> 38:57.790
No, this is it.
Really, I’m sorry.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.040
No. Tina.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.500
Tina!

39:02.170 --> 39:03.300
Ahh!

39:10.640 --> 39:11.640
What?

39:12.760 --> 39:13.430
Nate.

39:17.310 --> 39:18.140
Nate.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.110
Ah, great.

39:39.460 --> 39:42.380
Run, Nathan. Run.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.550
Nate.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.430
Oh, no. Nate, I’m not a runner.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.560
Have mercy. Nate.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.390
Oh, my lord.

39:59.890 --> 40:00.850
Stan?

40:01.440 --> 40:02.190
Stan.

40:03.440 --> 40:04.320
Come on.

40:06.440 --> 40:08.820
Hey. You okay?

40:09.450 --> 40:13.370
Yeah. I’m fine.
I just couldn’t run anymore.

40:15.370 --> 40:16.290
I can’t do this.

40:16.450 --> 40:18.000
Stan, I’m cursed.
Everyone’s against me.

40:18.450 --> 40:21.330
You’re not cursed,
but I won’t lie to you.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.580
This is going to be hard.

40:24.670 --> 40:27.590
Face everything
and deal with it, Nate.

40:27.710 --> 40:30.010
Running away
only delays the problem.

40:30.130 --> 40:31.090
I can’t.

40:31.590 --> 40:32.890
You can.

40:33.590 --> 40:35.180
This too shall pass.

40:35.430 --> 40:37.060
What does that even mean, Stan?

40:37.680 --> 40:41.770
It means that a year
from now, maybe even less,

40:42.650 --> 40:43.940
this won’t seem that important.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.150
Then why the
heck am I here, then?

40:46.440 --> 40:49.650
That’s a good question, Nate.
Why are you here?

40:50.900 --> 40:51.860
Girls and sports.

40:53.030 --> 40:56.330
That’s the wrong answer.
What’s the right answer, Stan?

40:56.450 --> 40:58.490
Why it’s to
keep him out of jail, Bob.

40:58.700 --> 41:01.080
You do realize that this

41:01.210 --> 41:03.790
is your only chance with
the judge, right?

41:06.210 --> 41:07.170
What do you get out of it?

41:08.340 --> 41:09.050
What?

41:12.300 --> 41:13.760
Everyone’s got an angle, Stan.

41:18.060 --> 41:20.720
Expelled! Seriously?

41:22.560 --> 41:24.190
He only just came back.

41:24.400 --> 41:27.020
I’m thinking about all
the students and their parents.

41:27.480 --> 41:28.820
I already had a
dozen calls about him

41:28.940 --> 41:30.440
coming back,
and I still took him in

41:30.900 --> 41:32.320
and on his first day,

41:32.440 --> 41:34.360
he rewards me by
punching out a window?

41:34.570 --> 41:36.160
Well, put yourself
in his shoes, John.

41:36.280 --> 41:38.080
Coming back here
after the way he left.

41:38.330 --> 41:40.490
Stan, your first
priority is to this school.

41:40.910 --> 41:42.500
You’re not a social worker.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.210
Is it? I mean, is it, though?

41:45.330 --> 41:48.710
Isn’t my first priority to
my students, all of them?

41:50.250 --> 41:51.590
You know, kids
come to me all the time,

41:51.710 --> 41:53.670
with some problem
they think is so big

41:53.800 --> 41:55.510
their whole life
is gonna be ruined,

41:55.630 --> 41:58.760
and I say to them, “Stand back.
Look at the big picture.

41:58.890 --> 41:59.810
You’ll get through this.

42:00.390 --> 42:01.430
One day you’ll look back at it

42:01.560 --> 42:02.980
and see it
wasn’t such a big deal.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.270
Your life
turned out just fine.”

42:06.900 --> 42:09.480
But you and I know this isn’t
a level playing field, John.

42:10.570 --> 42:12.480
Some kids are born
behind the eight ball,

42:13.690 --> 42:14.820
and we’re lying
to them when we say

42:14.950 --> 42:16.360
everything’s
gonna work out just fine.

42:18.160 --> 42:20.990
But don’t those kids deserve
the same chance as the others?

42:23.450 --> 42:26.210
I believe Nathan’s--

42:28.460 --> 42:30.130
There’s a good kid there.

42:32.380 --> 42:33.130
Please.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.130
Give him detention.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.930
Oh, my gosh.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.310
I think he’s gonna live
in detention until he graduates.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.440
So have you found
somewhere for him?

42:51.820 --> 42:54.570
No. No, I tried.

42:55.740 --> 42:57.200
There’s no room at the inn.

42:58.570 --> 42:59.370
You’ve gotta be careful.

43:00.570 --> 43:02.740
This is not the same
as being their teacher.

43:03.450 --> 43:04.160
I know that.

43:04.450 --> 43:05.290
No.

43:06.960 --> 43:07.750
You don’t.

43:08.830 --> 43:10.210
I had this student one time.

43:13.050 --> 43:16.510
She lost her dad, and then
her mom became an alcoholic.

43:17.470 --> 43:19.220
She completely shut down.

43:19.720 --> 43:20.890
Stopped showing up to school.

43:21.720 --> 43:23.310
So I tried to help.

43:24.600 --> 43:25.930
Had her come to the house.

43:27.020 --> 43:28.390
But, uh...

43:29.940 --> 43:31.730
It really affected
Robert and the girls.

43:34.480 --> 43:35.440
What did you do?

43:39.240 --> 43:41.070
I didn’t do anything.

43:43.200 --> 43:49.120
I watched her slip through
the cracks and into the system.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.920
I never saw her again.

44:26.870 --> 44:28.160
Okay.

44:31.670 --> 44:34.290
Please keep in mind,
no speaking unless spoken to.

44:34.460 --> 44:37.840
No arguing with the
Judge and look like a graduate.

44:38.340 --> 44:39.720
Do you have another tie?

44:41.760 --> 44:42.630
Never mind.

44:44.470 --> 44:45.680
You said this was good.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.220
Remember, this too shall pass.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.850
Mr. Deen? Is it Mr. Stan Deen?

44:53.810 --> 44:54.810
This is Mr. Deen, Your Honor.

44:54.940 --> 44:55.980
Yes, thank you, Council.

44:56.270 --> 44:57.940
Mr. Deen, I understand you are

44:58.070 --> 45:00.400
providing supervision
for the defendant?

45:01.070 --> 45:02.150
Yes, Your Honor.

45:02.280 --> 45:04.200
Thank you, Mr. Deen, and
the defendant’s grandparents

45:04.320 --> 45:05.990
are prepared to
assign custody to you?

45:06.280 --> 45:07.370
Yes, we will.

45:09.160 --> 45:11.790
And are you willing to
take on this responsibility?

45:12.040 --> 45:13.250
I am, Your Honor.

45:18.210 --> 45:19.420
Nathan Williams.

45:21.880 --> 45:24.800
This charge carries an automatic
two-year minimum sentence.

45:25.010 --> 45:27.050
I feel encouraged by
your return to school

45:27.180 --> 45:28.510
and your plans to graduate.

45:30.140 --> 45:32.640
I am minded to suspend
the bulk of that sentence.

45:32.770 --> 45:35.690
And I note this is your first
appearance before the court.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.320
72 hours at the local prison

45:40.440 --> 45:42.070
will give you a taste
of what awaits

45:42.190 --> 45:43.570
if you stray from your plan.

45:44.110 --> 45:45.610
Failure to graduate guarantees

45:45.740 --> 45:48.120
you serve
the sentence in full.

45:48.450 --> 45:50.370
You will be appointed
a probation officer

45:50.490 --> 45:51.750
to monitor your progress.

45:52.120 --> 45:53.210
Thank you, Council.

45:55.670 --> 45:56.540
That’s it?

45:56.670 --> 45:57.880
Yeah, you did great.

46:06.470 --> 46:08.970
You did it. I’m proud of you.

46:09.180 --> 46:10.350
I didn’t do anything.

46:10.470 --> 46:12.140
I stood there,
and kept my mouth shut.

46:12.600 --> 46:13.560
Exactly.

46:17.440 --> 46:18.650
So you knew the judge?

46:18.860 --> 46:20.020
Not really.

46:20.150 --> 46:21.320
Her daughter was in one of my

46:21.440 --> 46:24.150
performing arts
classes years ago.

46:25.320 --> 46:26.410
She’s on Broadway now.

46:27.450 --> 46:28.820
Sweet girl.

46:31.290 --> 46:35.540
You know, we can’t have you
sleeping on the couch anymore.

46:36.370 --> 46:37.420
Come on.

46:41.130 --> 46:43.170
I think you’ll be
more comfortable here.

46:44.170 --> 46:45.670
What about your mom’s stuff?

46:46.090 --> 46:47.630
This is your room now.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.120
What’s going on?

47:12.580 --> 47:13.540
What do you doing this weekend?

47:13.660 --> 47:14.370
Uh, nothing.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.290
God, Carl is such a douche.

47:18.790 --> 47:20.210
He thinks he’s Mr. Miami Vice,

47:20.330 --> 47:23.210
but he’s more like Donny
Osmond than he is Don Johnson.

47:27.720 --> 47:28.680
Maybe.

47:34.680 --> 47:35.850
They built the scene.

47:36.270 --> 47:38.060
Yeah. That’s good.

47:38.270 --> 47:39.190
-Yeah.
-Better.

47:40.350 --> 47:41.190
Nice.

47:42.270 --> 47:43.400
How’s the job hunt going?

47:43.520 --> 47:45.480
No, no one hires people
with a criminal record, Stan.

47:45.610 --> 47:46.280
I told you that.

47:46.400 --> 47:48.070
Okay, well,
it’s not gonna help, obviously,

47:48.240 --> 47:49.700
but get your grades up
and graduate.

47:49.820 --> 47:50.860
It will change.

47:52.030 --> 47:53.950
Hey, I could use your help.

47:54.410 --> 47:56.040
Building sets
for our new production.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.370
-There it is.
-What?

47:57.500 --> 47:58.370
You do want something from me.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.000
No, no. If I can’t
get a pay job,

48:00.120 --> 48:01.040
I have to work for my board.

48:01.170 --> 48:02.420
That’s not what I meant.

48:02.540 --> 48:04.340
That’s it, Stan. No, I’m not
interested in your stupid play.

48:04.460 --> 48:06.130
I’d say that’s pretty clear.

48:06.420 --> 48:07.170
Wait.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.130
Tina’s in this thing, right?

48:09.880 --> 48:11.010
-Yes, but--
-I’ll do it.

48:16.890 --> 48:18.390
You got this.

48:19.060 --> 48:20.560
This is just another
bump in the road.

48:21.730 --> 48:23.020
Remember, a year from now--

48:23.150 --> 48:23.900
Got it.

48:24.730 --> 48:26.400
This too shall pass.

48:34.490 --> 48:36.290
St. Bethany’s in ’73.

48:37.330 --> 48:38.950
That would have made you, six?

48:39.830 --> 48:40.620
Yeah.

48:41.210 --> 48:42.670
There till ’83,

48:42.790 --> 48:44.960
including four different
foster home placements.

48:46.460 --> 48:47.340
Okay.

48:47.920 --> 48:49.010
Where are you now?

48:49.840 --> 48:50.840
I’m with my teacher.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.220
Your teacher?

48:53.010 --> 48:54.220
What about your grandparents?

48:54.550 --> 48:55.930
No, they gave away custody.

48:56.390 --> 48:57.720
What about your
last foster parents?

48:58.020 --> 49:01.390
The-- was it the Williams?

49:01.850 --> 49:03.060
They should be
your legal guardians.

49:03.190 --> 49:03.980
No, you should be with them.

49:04.100 --> 49:06.020
No, no. The judge said
I could be with my teacher.

49:06.480 --> 49:07.440
It should be there.

49:07.570 --> 49:09.230
There’s no
record of that here.

49:10.190 --> 49:12.360
The Williams
are your guardians.

49:12.570 --> 49:13.280
You should be--

49:13.450 --> 49:15.030
Nah. They said
I could be with him.

49:15.160 --> 49:16.450
This is ridiculous.

49:16.620 --> 49:17.280
Hey, Viola!

49:17.620 --> 49:18.370
Yeah?

49:18.950 --> 49:21.460
I need some records
of the court case.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.330
Hey, Barney!

49:24.080 --> 49:24.750
Hey, Stan!

49:24.880 --> 49:26.540
Hey! How’s Maggie?

49:26.880 --> 49:28.090
Oh, I can’t complain.

49:28.210 --> 49:30.090
She started her own
business a few years back.

49:30.340 --> 49:31.670
You’re kidding.
That’s great.

49:32.090 --> 49:33.470
See, you met my student.

49:34.260 --> 49:36.390
He’s staying with me
till he gets back on his feet.

49:36.510 --> 49:37.890
The judge signed off on it.

49:38.060 --> 49:39.470
So he told me.

49:40.850 --> 49:43.560
Well, your teacher’s Stan Deen.

49:44.060 --> 49:45.350
Why didn’t you say so?

49:53.070 --> 49:55.160
Okay, so you’ve got
72 hours of prison time

49:55.280 --> 49:56.570
coming up in
the new year, right?

49:56.820 --> 49:57.530
Right.

49:57.660 --> 49:59.370
All right, check
in with me once a week.

50:00.080 --> 50:01.410
I run a tight ship.

50:04.790 --> 50:06.080
Is there anyone
you don’t know?

50:06.420 --> 50:07.580
Well, yes there is actually.

50:07.710 --> 50:08.840
I don’t know her.

50:09.590 --> 50:11.170
I don’t know them.
I don’t know her.

50:11.300 --> 50:12.260
Merry Christmas, Mr. Deen.

50:12.380 --> 50:14.050
Oh, Merry Christmas, Annabelle.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.510
-Right.
-We should be getting home.

51:40.970 --> 51:42.390
Keep going.

51:43.430 --> 51:45.520
Wow, good job.

51:45.640 --> 51:47.230
Look at those moves.

51:47.560 --> 51:49.850
You know who’s going to
be in my next musical, right?

51:50.440 --> 51:52.270
OK, guys, this is your set.

51:55.690 --> 51:57.240
It looks great.
Good job.

51:57.740 --> 51:58.820
Good job.

52:01.320 --> 52:02.910
And this is Algernon,
right?

52:19.090 --> 52:21.970
Merry Christmas, Nathan.
Ho, ho, ho.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.310
Who are all these presents for?

52:26.430 --> 52:27.350
They’re for you.

52:28.020 --> 52:29.100
All of them? They’re all mine?

52:29.310 --> 52:30.310
Let me check.

52:32.310 --> 52:35.980
Yours, yours,
yours, yours, yours.

52:36.690 --> 52:38.280
Yep, all yours.

52:38.610 --> 52:39.990
You bought all these for me?

52:40.360 --> 52:41.530
Of course.

52:46.330 --> 52:48.950
Nate. Nate!

52:50.410 --> 52:52.870
Now what?

54:50.120 --> 54:53.240
Nate. Get in the car.

54:57.750 --> 54:58.920
Nate.

55:00.880 --> 55:02.170
What’s wrong?

55:04.460 --> 55:05.720
It doesn’t matter.

55:07.760 --> 55:09.260
Why’d you do that, Stan?

55:09.390 --> 55:10.510
Buy all that shit?

55:11.180 --> 55:13.520
Is it--am I poor little homeless
boy? I’m a charity case?

55:13.640 --> 55:15.270
It would make you feel good?
What?

55:15.390 --> 55:19.480
No. Gosh, no. I mean,
I was trying to--

55:20.440 --> 55:22.650
You do know
it’s Christmas, right?

55:23.480 --> 55:24.820
I’ve never gotten
Christmas presents.

55:25.780 --> 55:27.150
You never got
a Christmas present?

55:28.660 --> 55:30.490
We used to do
underwear at the orphanage.

55:32.450 --> 55:33.330
Underwear?

55:35.080 --> 55:36.250
Oh, geez.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.160
Gosh darn it.

55:39.960 --> 55:40.880
I forgot underwear.

55:41.040 --> 55:42.790
Oh, God.
Everything’s not a joke.

55:43.170 --> 55:44.670
Stan, everything’s not funny.

55:44.800 --> 55:46.920
Okay. Okay.

55:48.090 --> 55:49.180
So why’d you do it?

55:50.220 --> 55:52.470
I was trying to
make you feel good, Nate.

55:54.010 --> 55:55.680
I want you to
have a good Christmas.

55:58.390 --> 55:59.140
That’s all.

55:59.270 --> 55:59.940
That’s all.

56:00.060 --> 56:01.270
Well, what else would it be?

56:01.440 --> 56:03.480
Bullshit. Stan,
everyone wants something back.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.950
You know, for eight years,
it’s just been me and my mom.

56:14.280 --> 56:16.540
She always said I smothered her.

56:17.000 --> 56:19.370
Stop it, Stan. Don’t fuss.

56:21.920 --> 56:25.920
I didn’t have anyone
to buy presents for this year.

56:26.170 --> 56:28.010
I guess I was
thinking about me.

56:29.090 --> 56:30.130
I’m sorry.

56:31.300 --> 56:32.510
I apologize.

56:33.850 --> 56:35.560
Merry Christmas,
Mr. Deen.

56:35.720 --> 56:38.020
Oh, Merry Christmas.

56:39.140 --> 56:40.520
Who was that?

56:41.140 --> 56:42.900
Please, can we get in the car?

56:45.020 --> 56:46.400
Have mercy.

56:49.440 --> 56:50.320
Right.

56:51.280 --> 56:54.280
Now I see how this might come
across as a little overboard.

56:54.740 --> 56:55.660
Yeah, you think?

56:56.530 --> 56:57.580
You know, I
didn’t get you anything.

56:58.080 --> 56:59.120
Actually, you did.

57:10.170 --> 57:12.050
Do--
Here. Here you go.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.590
Merry Christmas,
Stan.

57:13.720 --> 57:14.930
Merry Christmas, Stan.

57:15.140 --> 57:16.550
Thank you, Nate.

57:18.220 --> 57:19.350
What is it?

57:26.400 --> 57:27.770
Just what I wanted.

57:28.110 --> 57:29.360
Thank you, Nate.

57:31.440 --> 57:33.660
Right. Now let’s
get to the good part.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.240
Merry Christmas, Nate.

57:37.700 --> 57:39.290
You’re the weirdest person ever.

57:41.580 --> 57:44.330
Uh, you know that
Hershey bar you gave me?

57:44.670 --> 57:45.540
The one in class?

57:45.710 --> 57:46.460
Yeah.

57:47.170 --> 57:48.800
At the orphanage,

57:48.920 --> 57:51.840
when I first went to the
orphanage, I didn’t talk.

57:53.260 --> 57:55.130
For two years,
I just didn’t speak.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.430
And the keepers
would always bribe me

57:57.550 --> 57:59.060
with a candy bar
to get me to talk.

57:59.470 --> 58:01.930
And I never did.

58:02.560 --> 58:04.230
Never took it.
And I never talked, so.

58:06.150 --> 58:08.310
I know when you did that,
you didn’t want anything back.

58:08.820 --> 58:09.730
You know, so.

58:11.150 --> 58:12.070
Thank you.

58:12.650 --> 58:13.780
You’re welcome.

58:28.250 --> 58:29.290
Stan.

58:31.050 --> 58:32.840
Merry Christmas, Nate.

58:37.050 --> 58:38.930
Alice is an attractive
woman. She’s not married.

58:39.430 --> 58:40.310
And there’s nothing wrong.

58:40.470 --> 58:42.720
You stay away from
your sister’s friends.

58:42.970 --> 58:44.140
Do you hear me, Charlie?

58:44.430 --> 58:46.190
You’ve got to
stay away from girls.

58:46.440 --> 58:48.860
If you go near a girl,
I’m going to put you in a cage

58:48.980 --> 58:50.270
for the rest of your life.

58:50.650 --> 58:53.150
Do you hear me,
Charlie? Do you hear me?

58:53.280 --> 58:57.240
Okay, Carol. You need to be
really scary, okay?

58:57.990 --> 58:58.780
Look.

58:59.530 --> 59:02.120
When Charlie tries to be
romantic and close with Alice,

59:02.240 --> 59:04.250
he gets this
sudden memory of his mom

59:04.370 --> 59:06.960
being all mean
to him because as a kid,

59:07.210 --> 59:09.710
whenever he’d have those
feelings for any girl,

59:09.830 --> 59:12.960
that’s how she’d react, okay?
Really mean.

59:13.500 --> 59:16.380
So these memories,
they pop out of nowhere

59:16.510 --> 59:18.800
and it really frightens
Charlie, okay?

59:19.050 --> 59:20.090
Try again.

59:28.730 --> 59:30.560
Oh, rehearsal shots.

59:32.570 --> 59:34.360
Yeah, I thought they could
use them for the program.

59:34.480 --> 59:35.490
If they want.

59:35.650 --> 59:37.820
Oh, they’ll want.
These are good.

59:39.450 --> 59:40.700
Yeah, cool.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.410
These are good, Nate.
Where did you learn to do this?

59:48.040 --> 59:49.750
At a foster family I went to.

59:49.870 --> 59:51.330
One of the real kids
there had a camera

59:51.460 --> 59:52.750
and I stole it and used it.

59:53.090 --> 59:53.960
Real kids?

59:54.710 --> 59:56.010
Yeah, yeah.
That’s what we used

59:56.130 --> 59:57.220
to call them in the orphanage.

59:58.930 --> 01:00:00.430
What was the orphanage like?

01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:03.680
It was alright.
Keepers are okay.

01:00:04.220 --> 01:00:05.060
Keepers?

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:08.230
Yeah, they ran it.
They tried their best.

01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.480
Do you remember your
home before that? Where it was?

01:00:14.770 --> 01:00:16.190
No, not really.

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:19.200
My mom used to
call it Green Acres.

01:00:19.990 --> 01:00:21.320
After the TV show?

01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:23.030
Right.

01:00:23.660 --> 01:00:25.660
So was she like Eva Gabor?

01:00:28.410 --> 01:00:29.620
She was the star of the show.

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.870
Very glamorous. Very beautiful.

01:00:33.210 --> 01:00:34.790
Yeah, yeah, I guess so,
yeah.

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:36.800
She stood out. Remember that.

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:39.220
We’d go out and people
would stare at her all the time.

01:00:40.170 --> 01:00:41.550
Remember feeling pretty cool.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:43.850
And your dad?

01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:46.060
Maybe that could be
the cover of the program.

01:00:46.850 --> 01:00:48.930
Hmm. Wonder why.

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:58.530
Once more unto the breach,
dear friends, once more;

01:00:58.650 --> 01:01:02.700
Or close the wall up
with our English dead.

01:01:06.990 --> 01:01:08.240
Nathan...

01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:10.660
We’re gonna play a
new game tonight, okay?

01:01:10.790 --> 01:01:11.960
It’s gonna be a lot of fun.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:14.290
We’re gonna run,
really, really fast.

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.500
As far as we can,
for as long as we can.

01:01:16.630 --> 01:01:19.340
And we’re not gonna stop
until I say so, okay?

01:01:20.050 --> 01:01:23.340
You can do that?
You promise me? Okay.

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.300
Okay, c’mon sweetie.

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:28.350
Gloria,
come on down.

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:31.600
Nathan, hurry.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.140
Come on, quicker.

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:35.770
Run now, baby, run.

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:32.790
I can’t help you.
Mom...

01:02:58.230 --> 01:02:59.560
Look.

01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:03.110
It’s so calm and peaceful.

01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.610
And we’ll be
together forever.

01:03:21.130 --> 01:03:22.300
Gloria!

01:03:55.910 --> 01:04:01.630
Hey, looking for
newspapers from like early 1973.

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.040
Would you have those?

01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:10.090
Thank you.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.120
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:16.080
I can’t see you anymore, Nate.

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:17.030
What part of that
don’t you understand?

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.290
-Just let me explain.
-Explain what?

01:05:18.490 --> 01:05:21.370
You were arrested,
and now you’re a changed man.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.210
You’re going back to prison.

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:26.960
Yeah for,
for a few days, Tina.

01:05:28.090 --> 01:05:29.380
Then it will be done with.

01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:30.300
Stage
light’s going out.

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:34.800
Okay, just
leave me alone, Nathan.

01:05:40.140 --> 01:05:41.350
Tina.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:43.640
Tina!

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:46.150
Come on, can
we just talk, please?

01:05:46.270 --> 01:05:46.980
No, we can’t talk.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:47.980
-Tina!
-What?

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:48.860
Come on.

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:49.690
Ow!

01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.110
Stop! What are you doing?

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:54.780
Tina,
get in the car.

01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:55.950
Daddy, we weren’t even--

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.780
Get in the car!

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.120
Nathan, stay
away from Tina, okay?

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.750
So don’t talk to
her, don’t touch her,

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.130
just stay the hell
away from my daughter, got it?

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.880
Nathan, do we
understand each other?

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:13.380
Yeah, okay, I get it.

01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:20.310
It’s only
for 72 hours, okay?

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:23.100
Call me when you’re
ready for me to pick you up.

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:24.390
And remember--

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.480
Don’t.

01:06:25.770 --> 01:06:26.900
Don’t say it, Stan.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.860
Okay, listen,
Tina, when you cross downstage,

01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:16.900
don’t cross in
front of Barnaby, okay?

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:18.740
All right, let’s
take it from your entrance.

01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:21.030
-All right, and Barnaby?
-Yeah.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:24.040
I’m about ready to give
my doctor his marching orders

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:25.500
and sign up with you.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.870
Thanks, Mr. D.

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.830
I take Blue Cross
and Blue Shield.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.460
Okay, good for you.

01:07:30.670 --> 01:07:31.500
Okay, here we go.

01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:34.420
And remember,
project, project, project.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:35.260
Yes, sir.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.800
It’s really
coming along, Stan.

01:07:37.170 --> 01:07:37.930
Oh, thanks.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:39.010
Yeah.

01:07:39.390 --> 01:07:41.430
John asked me to come down
and speak with you for a minute.

01:07:41.970 --> 01:07:42.810
Okay.

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.850
Guys, take five.

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:48.850
We have a problem.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:58.700
-It sucked.
-Good.

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:01.120
It wasn’t supposed
to be the Ritz.

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:04.120
I have some bad news for you.

01:08:04.620 --> 01:08:05.540
It’s about Tina.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.040
She’s out of bounds.

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:08.660
That’s not fair, Stan.

01:08:08.790 --> 01:08:09.870
Nate, look
at the big picture.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.540
No, I get it.
I get it.

01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:13.670
Help me, Stan.

01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.670
I like her. I have...

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.130
real feelings for her.
How do I handle that?

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:19.630
I can’t just make them go away.

01:08:53.210 --> 01:08:54.000
I will.

01:08:54.710 --> 01:08:56.250
It may not
have very long...

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:39.460
I’m gonna catch you,
later.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:41.630
Hey, would you,
would you wait a minute?

01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:42.680
What?

01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:44.680
I just, I brought you flowers.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.430
I wanted to say
you did a great job.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.140
I know you can’t talk
to me anymore or whatever,

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.600
but I thought you should know
how great you were on stage.

01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.400
Hey, I’ve,
I’ve turned it around.

01:09:57.190 --> 01:09:58.730
Okay, I have, and I
know your dad doesn’t want us

01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.570
talking anymore or whatever.

01:09:59.690 --> 01:10:01.240
It’s not my
dad, Nathan, okay?

01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:02.950
It’s me.

01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:05.910
Great show, man.
You killed it.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.950
-Congrats.
-Thank you so much.

01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:09.660
Thank you, so much.

01:10:09.790 --> 01:10:10.740
I picked them out
myself, right?

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.080
They’re beautiful.

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:14.160
-Thank you.
-Get out of here.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.080
Man, I can do
what I want.

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:17.250
-Nate!
-She’s not your girl anymore.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:18.960
Stop!

01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:21.590
What are you doing?

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:24.800
Just ruin everything.

01:10:38.810 --> 01:10:40.360
Hey Nate!

01:11:03.510 --> 01:11:04.590
Let’s get out of here.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.590
Yeah.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:22.070
Where were you?

01:11:23.190 --> 01:11:25.440
Your probation officer?
You had a meeting?

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:26.860
So what?
I messed up.

01:11:27.150 --> 01:11:29.320
You attacked
a student at school!

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:31.700
With a bunch of flowers,
Stan. Come on.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:34.790
When are you gonna
stop pulling this crap, Nathan?

01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:36.620
It’s what I do, Stan?

01:11:36.830 --> 01:11:38.670
You gonna try and fix me?
You know many people have tried?

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:40.960
Why, you ungrateful little--

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.170
No, say it.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.010
Was it ungrateful little...

01:11:46.170 --> 01:11:47.050
-Shit.
-Yeah.

01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:48.010
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:11:48.180 --> 01:11:50.510
Yeah, shit.
A liar, a loser, a failure.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.890
I’ve heard it all before, Stan.
Screw you, dude.

01:11:53.010 --> 01:11:54.140
Screw me, really, Nate?

01:11:54.260 --> 01:11:55.680
That’s a little
quaint for you, isn’t it?

01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:57.770
I mean, I guess this is better
than you mooching

01:11:57.890 --> 01:11:58.810
and slouching around.

01:11:58.940 --> 01:12:00.310
Maybe we’re getting somewhere.
Come on, what else you got?

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:01.480
-Get out of my face.
-Come on, what else you got?

01:12:01.610 --> 01:12:03.570
Everyone thinks
you’re frickin’ amazing, Stan.

01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.070
You’re just a
failed frickin’ actor.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:06.150
-Ooh.
-Yeah.

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:07.700
I mean, and one day
I’m gonna tell you exactly

01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:08.820
what’s frickin’ wrong with you.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.320
-Okay, let’s do it right now.
-You wanna do it right now?

01:12:10.450 --> 01:12:12.620
-Right now!
-You’re so frickin’ optimistic.

01:12:12.870 --> 01:12:14.330
Okay. What else?

01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:17.790
Go back to Hollywood, fail
again, stop trying to be safe.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.330
-Stan!
-And miss this.

01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:21.790
A fight with Nate Williams
at long last.

01:12:22.170 --> 01:12:24.960
Come on, Nate. What else
you got? I can take it.

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.130
You know, whether it’s
something your dad did to you

01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:31.760
or your mom didn’t do, you
have got to deal with it, Nate.

01:12:36.270 --> 01:12:37.020
You were gonna say something.

01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:37.980
-No, I wasn’t...no.
-You were.

01:12:38.100 --> 01:12:39.020
Please, tell me. I saw it.

01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.690
No, no, no.

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.770
I messed up, Stan.
That’s it.

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:45.020
Well, you can’t afford to
blow it anymore, Nate.

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:46.230
I don’t care!

01:12:46.610 --> 01:12:48.400
Why do you
care if I don’t care?

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.780
Am I supposed to be shocked?

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:51.950
Oh, forget it.

01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:57.370
Nate Williams doesn’t care
because he’s too cool.

01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:59.500
Well, guess what, Nate?

01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.540
I care.

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:03.790
Yeah.

01:13:04.630 --> 01:13:08.170
I care that you go
to school and you graduate.

01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:12.470
I care that you don’t
blow it with Barney

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.930
and the judge.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:19.350
I care that
you don’t go to prison.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:24.860
What did Barney say?

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.940
He’s not a happy man, Nate.

01:13:29.150 --> 01:13:30.690
Come on, let’s talk.

01:13:30.820 --> 01:13:31.610
We’re talking.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.410
Really talk?

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:36.740
I don’t know.

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:39.500
My dad was a bad person.
I’m a bad person.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.500
That’s what I’ve been told.
That’s what it is.

01:13:41.710 --> 01:13:44.210
Except you’re not
a bad person, okay?

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.040
You’ve just had bad luck.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.890
Yeah.

01:13:58.140 --> 01:13:59.010
Hey.

01:14:00.520 --> 01:14:02.560
I can’t let you
come on the trip, Nate.

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.640
You attacked Carl.

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.350
Yeah, it’s okay.
I get it.

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:06.940
It’s actually not okay.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:10.780
So...and
Barney needs to see you.

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.280
I’ll see you tonight.

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.640
Dude, I’m losing my mind.

01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:20.640
Yeah? Are you
ready to party?

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.180
-So ready.
-Alright.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.650
Yo Nate, where we goin’?

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:32.230
What about your place, Nate?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:33.150
Mr. Deen’s away.

01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.320
-I don’t know.
-Come on. It’ll be fun.

01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:37.030
Dude, we’re going.

01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:05.390
-Dude.
-Bro.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.930
-You made it.
-What’s up?

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:11.310
Good to see you, man.

01:16:11.610 --> 01:16:13.650
Hey, man. How you doing?
You look great.

01:16:23.410 --> 01:16:25.160
Dude, not on records.
Come on.

01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.580
Johnny, Johnny.

01:16:30.710 --> 01:16:32.380
Dude, who
are all these people?

01:16:32.630 --> 01:16:33.380
Yo, is this cool or what?

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.340
No, this is a disaster.

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:35.750
-What?
-It’s a disaster, Dude.

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:37.010
No, bro.

01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:39.010
Look at all these ladies.

01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:40.510
I’ll catch you later.

01:16:45.930 --> 01:16:46.930
Noah, dude.

01:16:47.430 --> 01:16:49.020
Noah, get out.

01:16:49.390 --> 01:16:50.730
Get out, dude.
Come on.

01:16:54.230 --> 01:16:55.270
Get out.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:09.710
Holy crap.
It’s everywhere.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.380
Everyone out.
Get the hell out.

01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.050
Wait, wait, It’s okay.
It’s okay.

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:23.180
Get the hell out.

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.390
Whoa, whoa, guys,
guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:27.930
Yo, party at my place, yeah?

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:29.770
Yeah. Whoa, let’s roll.

01:17:35.110 --> 01:17:35.980
That was so good, Mr. Deen.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.070
It was, wasn’t it?

01:17:37.190 --> 01:17:38.530
-Yeah...So good.
-Okay.

01:17:38.730 --> 01:17:39.820
The lighting, Mr. D...

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:40.990
Awesome.

01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:42.610
Yeah, but
you know what, Travis,

01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.110
you can’t sing the lighting.

01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:45.320
-Good night.
-Good night, Mr. D.

01:17:45.450 --> 01:17:46.240
Good night.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:48.910
Okay, thank you.

01:18:13.020 --> 01:18:16.400
What on earth...

01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:26.450
Stan.

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:28.910
What is wrong with you?

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:29.790
Look, Stan, I--

01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:32.120
After everything
I’ve done for you.

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:36.750
Pearls before swine.

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:39.130
What does that mean?

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:42.590
It means what’s the
point in trying to help someone

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:44.340
who’s too
stupid to appreciate it?

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:46.380
That’s what that means, Nate.

01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:47.840
That’s what you think of me?

01:18:47.970 --> 01:18:50.350
Well, what am I
supposed to think, Nate?

01:18:53.230 --> 01:18:54.560
Look at this place.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.650
Some friends came over
and it got out of hand.

01:18:57.770 --> 01:18:59.020
I don’t want to hear it.

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.980
At least I have friends, Stan.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.070
Without my friends,
you’d be in jail.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:08.450
You just took me in
because you’re lonely.

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:10.950
Oh my lord.

01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:15.160
I can’t look at you right now.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:16.870
Just get out.

01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:26.010
Please.

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:27.970
Just get out.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:13.970
Hola amigo.

01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:16.390
Mi casa es tu casa.

01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:17.980
What are you doing?

01:20:20.020 --> 01:20:22.110
Just keepin’ her
warm for you, man.

01:20:22.940 --> 01:20:24.190
It’s a joke.

01:20:25.030 --> 01:20:27.190
All right, I think you
need a drink, huh?

01:20:27.820 --> 01:20:29.110
Yeah, let’s go.

01:20:36.370 --> 01:20:38.040
Welcome to Woodstock.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:40.920
Oh,...

01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:49.130
It’s not funny.

01:20:49.470 --> 01:20:50.840
It’s hilarious.

01:20:52.140 --> 01:20:52.890
Oh.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:03.270
I’m such an asshole.

01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:07.480
Old Stan, Stan the man,
he didn’t deserve that shit.

01:21:07.730 --> 01:21:09.490
How can I do that shit?

01:21:10.530 --> 01:21:12.410
But then, how
can I not do that?

01:21:12.660 --> 01:21:13.410
You know?

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.120
Excuse me, guys.

01:21:16.330 --> 01:21:17.910
-Hey, how you doing?
-Good, how are you?

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:21.580
Can I interest
you in a little bit of that? No?

01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:24.920
You said you
saw something in him.

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.710
That he had the potential
to be a good young man.

01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:31.840
You saw that.

01:21:37.180 --> 01:21:41.020
This is the senior year,
last semester.

01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:43.810
And I’ve seen worse.

01:21:46.980 --> 01:21:51.280
And the really important thing
to remember, Stan, is that...

01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:58.290
The really important thing
for me to remember?

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:02.210
Deb?

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.040
Deb?

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:12.720
What is the important thing?

01:22:13.170 --> 01:22:14.550
I’m listening.
What?

01:23:51.610 --> 01:23:53.530
Gloria!

01:24:09.870 --> 01:24:17.300
Please, stop, please!
Stop! Stop! No! No! No!

01:24:17.670 --> 01:24:18.470
Come on!

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:22.680
No! No! No! No! No!

01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:26.220
See what I
have for you.

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.020
Nathan!
Nathan, come on!

01:24:31.230 --> 01:24:32.480
Come on, run!

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.240
Nathan!

01:24:40.410 --> 01:24:42.820
Nathan, Nathan, come on!

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:06.850
Nathan.

01:25:06.970 --> 01:25:08.390
Get up, Mommy!

01:25:10.350 --> 01:25:11.270
Run.

01:25:29.790 --> 01:25:30.790
No.

01:27:59.190 --> 01:28:02.400
Hey, hey, hey, hey, no, no,
get down, don’t, don’t...

01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:49.820
Come on, man.
Come on.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.200
C’mon bud.

01:29:06.590 --> 01:29:09.720
Code blue, emergency room,
room three. Code blue.

01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:10.720
Hello?

01:29:10.930 --> 01:29:12.090
Room three.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.340
Code blue,
emergency room, room three.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:19.560
He’s asystole,
charge to 300.

01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:20.850
Get that CPR going.

01:29:21.270 --> 01:29:23.020
Oh, God, no,
please, no, no, no!

01:29:23.150 --> 01:29:24.110
Hey, hey,
clear the room.

01:29:24.310 --> 01:29:25.270
You cannot be in here!

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:26.570
-Out, out!
-You need to leave!

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.240
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.320
Where are we at?

01:29:33.490 --> 01:29:36.830
3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

01:29:36.950 --> 01:29:37.950
Did we get
any response from him?

01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:40.710
10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

01:29:40.830 --> 01:29:42.330
Any response from him?
Any response?

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:47.210
17, 18, 19, 20,
21, 22, 23, 24

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:51.920
Ah, we got him back.
Good. I see a pulse.

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.130
We’ve got a pulse.

01:29:53.430 --> 01:29:54.680
Give me the
blood pressure reading.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:56.100
Check his
pulse once again.

01:29:56.550 --> 01:29:57.310
Let’s order some labs.

01:29:57.510 --> 01:29:59.270
Give me a CBC, PFP.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:01.270
I need a neck
and chest x-ray.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.380
I can’t stop pissing.

01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.970
Well, you had yourself

01:30:37.090 --> 01:30:39.310
quite a party there last night,
young man.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:41.850
They got to
flush out your system.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:43.310
Good luck.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.570
Hey, Barney.

01:31:00.910 --> 01:31:01.700
Stan.

01:31:06.460 --> 01:31:08.170
I just wanted to come by,
see how you’re doing.

01:31:09.090 --> 01:31:09.920
I’m doing okay.

01:31:10.090 --> 01:31:11.500
He’s doing better.
Yeah.

01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:13.710
On his way to a full recovery.

01:31:15.010 --> 01:31:15.930
That’s good.

01:31:16.930 --> 01:31:18.800
Because obviously
as I’m your P.O.,

01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:20.720
they’ve told me everything.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:22.430
Right.

01:31:24.390 --> 01:31:26.230
What were you trying to do,
Nathan? Fly off that bridge?

01:31:26.850 --> 01:31:30.520
I mean you miss our appointment,
which is a violation.

01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:35.240
Then you end up in a
hospital with your system

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:38.530
full of enough narcotics
to knock out a horse.

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:42.790
You know what happens when
this gets in front of the judge.

01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:43.580
Please, Barney.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:46.910
Stan, it’s okay.
You’ve done enough.

01:31:49.670 --> 01:31:51.090
Sir, I know
what you have to do.

01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:55.010
Tell him what happened.

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.630
What?

01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:57.840
Tell Barney what happened.

01:31:57.970 --> 01:32:00.050
Tell me what happened.
I want to hear.

01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.890
He knows what happened.

01:32:02.010 --> 01:32:05.560
No. What happened
with your mom?

01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:08.980
You saw it.

01:32:10.650 --> 01:32:11.940
There was no accident.

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.240
Tell us. I’ll--
we’ll believe you.

01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:22.660
I’ll believe you.
Tell us.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:33.290
My father was an angry man.

01:32:35.050 --> 01:32:36.880
That’s all I ever remember.
That’s all I was ever told.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.140
He used to beat my mom.

01:32:41.720 --> 01:32:44.180
And eventually she just
got the cops to kick him out,

01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:45.140
told him to stay away.

01:32:45.890 --> 01:32:48.940
Then she met this
guy who just made her,

01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:51.230
he made her so happy.
She was so happy.

01:32:52.020 --> 01:32:54.190
Which-- that just,
drove my dad insane.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:55.440
Drove him crazy.

01:32:56.440 --> 01:32:59.650
And he-- I remember
he’d follow us in his car,

01:32:59.780 --> 01:33:02.700
stalking her basically, like
spying on her, spying on us.

01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:12.670
One day, after he-- Blake,

01:33:14.250 --> 01:33:16.090
was a, the guy
my mom was seeing, Blake.

01:33:16.250 --> 01:33:17.420
After he left, he
was staying at our house,

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:21.680
he left, and I guess
dad was just sitting there.

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:23.800
He’d been sitting
there all night just waiting,

01:33:24.350 --> 01:33:26.430
just watching and
waiting for Blake to leave.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:28.810
So when he did, he pulled in.

01:33:29.270 --> 01:33:30.850
And I ran up to him and I...

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.360
And he shot her.

01:33:41.650 --> 01:33:42.660
Shot her with
his hunting rifle.

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:43.860
Shot her twice.

01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:47.830
And I watched her die.

01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.290
After a while he,
he left, he went outside.

01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.630
After some time, I don’t
know how long, but I got up too.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:03.180
And I followed him and I
walked out to the front porch.

01:34:23.110 --> 01:34:24.410
I’m sorry, son.

01:34:26.530 --> 01:34:28.530
If I can’t have her,
no one else can.

01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:45.300
My God.

01:34:47.340 --> 01:34:48.510
Oh lord--

01:34:51.720 --> 01:34:54.190
I just stayed there,
sat there, until this woman,

01:34:54.730 --> 01:34:57.060
probably a neighbor, I think,
she came and picked me up

01:34:57.190 --> 01:34:59.190
and took me to her house,

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.190
put me in a tub and
washed all of his...

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:09.580
Nanny and Grandpa came,

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:12.160
and they picked me up and
they took me to their place.

01:35:13.410 --> 01:35:14.710
And Nanny was so upset.

01:35:14.910 --> 01:35:16.460
She was so
upset, of course, right?

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:20.340
But then, she said we couldn’t
say what actually happened.

01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:23.550
You have to say that
your mom died in a car crash.

01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:26.010
You have to say that
because then, you know,

01:35:26.130 --> 01:35:28.970
you can’t have people knowing
what your father had done.

01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:30.970
Because they’re going to think
that you’re going to grow up

01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:32.100
and you’re going to do
the same thing.

01:35:32.310 --> 01:35:34.270
That apple doesn’t
fall far from the tree shit.

01:35:35.980 --> 01:35:37.940
So whenever I’d say
what actually happened,

01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:40.820
that my father had killed
himself, after killing my mom,

01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.110
she’d stop me. She’d stop me and
say I was making up stories.

01:35:43.940 --> 01:35:44.820
And then I...

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:47.030
That’s what she told the
people at Bethany’s

01:35:47.150 --> 01:35:48.820
when she put me there.
So I just...

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:53.160
You know, I stopped talking.
I had nothing to say anyway.

01:36:00.840 --> 01:36:01.840
That was my fault.

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:03.670
What was?

01:36:04.130 --> 01:36:04.840
What he did.

01:36:06.130 --> 01:36:06.880
No, it wasn’t.

01:36:07.010 --> 01:36:08.260
You weren’t there, Stan.

01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:10.140
You weren’t there.
You didn’t see his face.

01:36:11.050 --> 01:36:12.680
You didn’t see his
reaction when I said...

01:36:13.930 --> 01:36:15.810
Because I ran up to him
when he got there, I said...

01:36:21.650 --> 01:36:23.570
I said, “Is Blake
going to be my new daddy?”

01:36:24.150 --> 01:36:26.860
The look on his
face was just pure...

01:36:28.110 --> 01:36:29.160
pain.

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:33.700
It wasn’t your fault?

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:35.450
No, it was. If I didn’t
say anything,

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:36.500
he wouldn’t have got so mad.

01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:37.960
It wasn’t your fault.

01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:47.210
He was already there, Nate.
That’s why he brought the gun.

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:53.510
Stop letting him off
the hook by blaming yourself.

01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:57.020
It wasn’t your fault.

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:09.320
Come on.

01:37:16.990 --> 01:37:17.870
Poor kid.

01:37:18.160 --> 01:37:18.910
Yeah.

01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:24.420
Next time, Stan,

01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:26.210
if he messes up again,

01:37:26.340 --> 01:37:29.220
he’s going straight in front of
the judge, so help me God.

01:37:29.720 --> 01:37:30.800
Thanks, Barney.

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:32.550
You tell him.

01:37:32.680 --> 01:37:35.640
I will. Thank you. Thank you.

01:37:44.270 --> 01:37:45.480
Hey, I gotta go somewhere.

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:48.780
Can you take me?

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.240
Hi mom.

01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:43.680
Okay, that’s it from me.
Merry Christmas, everybody.

01:39:43.810 --> 01:39:45.520
Merry Christmas!

01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:50.480
Adieu...adieu... remember me.

01:39:52.690 --> 01:39:53.820
See you next year.

01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.400
See you next year, Mr. Deen.

01:39:55.530 --> 01:39:56.320
See you next year.

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:57.740
See you next year, Mr. Deen.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.290
My God. I can’t believe it.

01:40:15.800 --> 01:40:17.470
Well, my life’s work is done.

01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:19.640
Nate Williams playing
Christmas mus--

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:20.680
Okay, come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:22.140
-We’re gonna go somewhere.
-What?

01:40:22.260 --> 01:40:23.060
You’ll find out.

01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.970
-Well, can I put my book bag--
-No, Stan. Come on.

01:40:25.770 --> 01:40:27.640
-Can we take my car?
-No. Come on.

01:40:30.060 --> 01:40:31.020
Where are we going?

01:40:31.230 --> 01:40:32.480
You’ll find out.

01:40:59.590 --> 01:41:01.390
You’re not putting me
in a home, are you?

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:03.850
Here.

01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:05.470
Take this.

01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:22.990
Hey, Max. How you doing, man?

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.740
Hey, Nate.
Good to see you.

01:41:24.870 --> 01:41:26.160
This is Mr. Deen.
Hi, Stan.

01:41:26.370 --> 01:41:27.740
Oh, hi, Stan. Welcome...

01:41:28.330 --> 01:41:29.290
So exciting.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.250
Yeah.
Yes.

01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:31.420
Should we get the kids?

01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.630
Let’s get the kids.
Yeah, let’s do it.

01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:35.250
Hey, guys.
Hey, Merry Christmas.

01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:36.380
Do you want to
come out here for a second?

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:37.170
Yeah.

01:41:37.300 --> 01:41:38.340
Come on. Let’s
go. Let’s go. Let’s go.

01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.840
Hey, Merry Christmas,
guys.

01:41:39.970 --> 01:41:41.050
Do you want to
come out here for a second?

01:41:41.180 --> 01:41:42.340
Sit down, guys. Come on.

01:41:43.390 --> 01:41:44.050
Yeah, cool.

01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:45.180
Come on, everyone.
Let’s go.

01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.560
Okay, guys. Come on in.
Come in. Sit down, guys.

01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:50.520
All right. Huh?

01:41:51.140 --> 01:41:53.100
All right. Don’t be shy.
Come on down.

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:55.400
All right. Huh? Merry Christmas.

01:41:57.440 --> 01:41:58.440
My name’s Nate.

01:41:58.860 --> 01:42:00.530
I used to live here,
like you guys.

01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:02.450
I was here on and
off about eight years.

01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:04.990
And, I remember Christmas.

01:42:05.780 --> 01:42:07.030
You guys
still get the underwear?

01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:08.040
Yeah.

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.330
Yeah. Look, hey,

01:42:09.450 --> 01:42:11.870
I just graduated high
school last summer.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.880
And I just wanted to let
you guys know that, you know,

01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:16.670
you got to hang in there.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.340
You know, there are people
out there who will help you,

01:42:19.460 --> 01:42:20.460
who want to help you.

01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.050
You just got to let them.

01:42:22.550 --> 01:42:25.090
You know, for me, it
was my teacher, Mr. Stan Deen.

01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.180
Everyone say hi, Mr. Deen.

01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:27.760
Hi!

01:42:28.930 --> 01:42:31.180
Well, hello, everyone.
Merry Christmas.

01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.980
Look at what we got.

01:42:32.140 --> 01:42:33.440
Merry Christmas!

01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:35.310
How many did you bring?

01:42:35.810 --> 01:42:36.650
See, it’s not weird.

01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:37.860
They’re not all for
the same person.

01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.980
How did you pay for them?

01:42:39.150 --> 01:42:40.110
You did.

01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.070
The money I asked for
to fix my car.

01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:43.700
I’ll pay you back.

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.330
You already did.

01:42:50.660 --> 01:42:51.330
Stan.

01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:54.370
We got to throw
one soft one.

01:42:54.500 --> 01:42:55.170
Three, two, one.

01:42:55.290 --> 01:42:55.960
Hey!

01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:56.830
Oh, no!

01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:58.340
Gentlemen,
gentlemen, gentlemen.

01:42:58.460 --> 01:42:59.380
Come on, pass it back.

01:42:59.630 --> 01:43:00.380
All right, everybody.

01:43:00.500 --> 01:43:01.960
One for everyone.
